## Traffic Flow Modeling:
 - Simulations can model and analyze the flow of traffic within a city, considering factors such as road layours, signal timings, and the behaviour of drivers.
 - Microscopic models simulate individual vehicles and their interactions, while macroscopic models focus on overall traffic patterns.

## Transportation Infrastructure Planning:
 - Simulations help in evaluating the effectiveness of existing transportation infrastructure and planning for future developments.
 - Planners can simulate the impact of new roads, public transportation systems, or changes to existing infrastructure to assess their effects on traffic flow and congestion.
